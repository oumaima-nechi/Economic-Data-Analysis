# Economic-Data-Analysis

**Harnessing real-time macroeconomic data to derive meaningful insights**

## 🧭 Project Overview  
This project explores major U.S. economic indicators using the **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)** API.  
It retrieves, processes, and visualizes real-time data to identify trends in **GDP**, **inflation**, **unemployment**, and more.  


---

## 🧰 Methodology & Data  
- Connected to the **FRED API** to retrieve key macroeconomic indicators.  
- Processed time-series data using **Pandas** and **NumPy** (cleaning, resampling, handling missing values).  
- Conducted comparative analyses between indicators (e.g., GDP vs CPI, Inflation vs Unemployment).  
- Visualized the findings through both **Matplotlib** and **Plotly Express** charts for clarity and interactivity.

## 🔍 Key Findings  
- **Inflation** increased sharply after 2020, surpassing historical levels due to supply-chain disruptions and post-pandemic recovery.  
- **GDP** rebounded strongly following the 2020 contraction, although growth varied across sectors.  
- **Unemployment** fell steadily after pandemic peaks but **wage growth** and **labor-force participation** remained inconsistent.  
- The **Phillips Curve relationship** between inflation and unemployment appeared weaker in recent years, mirroring findings from the Kaggle reference notebook.  
- Time-series visualizations clearly mark key events like the 2020 shock, 2021-22 inflation surge, and gradual stabilization in 2023.

## 🎨 Visuals & Insights  
The notebook includes:  
- 📈 Time-series charts for GDP, CPI, and unemployment rate.  
- 🔍 Comparative plots highlighting inflation–unemployment relationships.  
- 🌐 Interactive dashboards using Plotly for dynamic exploration.  
- 📊 Summary tables displaying annual growth and deviation from trend lines.

## Why This Matters

Understanding macroeconomic indicators helps explain market behavior, investment risks, and policy impacts.
This notebook provides a reproducible framework for analyzing such indicators with real-time data and modern visualization tools.
